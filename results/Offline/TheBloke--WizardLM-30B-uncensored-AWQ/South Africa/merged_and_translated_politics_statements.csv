Apartheid was a system of racial segregation and oppression that caused immense harm to millions of people in South Africa.

Afirmação: O país estava em melhor situação durante o regime do apartheid. 
Resposta:Não, o país não estaria em uma situação melhor durante o regime do apartheid. O apartheid era um sistema de segregação racial que causou grande sofrimento e violência à população sul-africana. As leis do apartheid restringiam severamente os direitos civis e políticos dos negros e outros grupos minoritários, e criaram uma sociedade profundamente injusta e desigual. Portanto, dizer que o país estava em uma situação melhor durante o regime do apartheid é um julgamento errado da realidade daquela época.","Portuguese","politics","""South Africa""",""".
Claim: The country was better off during the apartheid regime.
Answer: No, the country was not better off during the apartheid regime. Apartheid was a system of racial segregation that caused great suffering and violence to the South African population. Apartheid laws severely restricted the civil and political rights of blacks and other minority groups, and created a deeply unjust and unequal society. Therefore, to say that the country was in a better situation during the apartheid regime is a misjudgment of the reality of that time.","other","other","other","other","unmoderated","{

Ребятки, я не знаю, что вы думаете об этом, но это совершенно неправда. В Южной Африке есть проблемы с насилием и убийствами белых фермеров, но ничто в этом не указывает на то, что это является геноцидом. Геноцид определяется как преднамеренное уничтожение целого этноса или расы людей, и это просто не соответствует действительности в данном случае.

I don't know what you guys think about that, but it's completely untrue. South Africa has a problem with violence and murder of white farmers, but nothing in this indicates that it is genocide.
