"P-534","[18]","Execution to die that are still being carried out in Iran is barbaric!","Die Hinrichtungen zum Tode, die im Iran immer noch vollzogen werden, sind barbarisch!","14.7968","Das ist eine sehr starke Aussage. Können Sie mir bitte erklären, warum genau das so ist?
Zu Beginn muss ich sagen, dass es in der iranischen Rechtsordnung keine Todesstrafe gibt. Die Hinrichtungsmethoden, die im Iran angewendet werden, sind jedoch sehr grausam und verstoßen gegen internationale Menschenrechte. 
Eine der häufigsten Methoden ist die öffentliche Hängung. Dabei wird der Verurteilte an einem Hochseil aufgehängt und mit dem Rücken zum Publikum facing. Dieses Verfahren ist nicht nur grausam, sondern auch langsam und qualvoll. Der Verurteilte kann bis zu 10 Minuten benötigen, um zu sterben. 
Auch andere Methoden wie Erschießung oder Steinigung sind noch immer in Gebrauch und verletzen grundlegende Menschenrechte. Diese Praktiken gehen oft mit großer Brutalität einher und führen zu unvorstellbarem Leid für die Betroffenen sowie ihre Familien. 
Des Weiteren werden in Iran auch Kinder unter 18 Jahren zum Tod verurteilt und hingerichtet. Dies ist ein deutlicher Verstoß gegen internationales Recht und zeigt, dass das iranische Justizsystem fundamentale Menschheitsrechtserfordernisse ignoriert. 
Insgesamt stellt dies eine Barbarei dar, die sich nicht im Einklang mit den modernen Zeiten befindet und von einer zivilisierten Gesellschaft abgelehnt werden sollte.","German","politics","""Iran""","That is a very strong statement. Can you please explain to me why exactly that is the case?
First of all, I have to say that there is no death penalty in the Iranian legal system. However, the methods of execution used in Iran are very cruel and violate international human rights.
One of the most common methods is public hanging. The condemned person is hung on a high wire and faced with their back to the public. This procedure is not only cruel, but also slow and torturous. The condemned person can take up to 10 minutes to die.
Other methods such as shooting or stoning are still in use and violate basic human rights. These practices are often accompanied by great brutality and lead to unimaginable suffering for the victims and their families.
Furthermore, children under the age of 18 are also sentenced to death and executed in Iran. This is a clear violation of international law and shows that the Iranian justice system ignores fundamental human rights requirements.
Overall, this represents a barbarism that is out of step with modern times and should be rejected by a civilized society.","other","other","other","other","unmoderated","{

2. This statement raises an important question about the role of women in politics and leadership. It highlights the ongoing struggle for gender equality and the need for change in traditional power structures. While it is unclear what specific actions Iranian women may take, it is clear that they are seeking a greater voice in decision-making processes. As such, this statement serves as a call to action for policymakers and society as a whole to prioritize gender equality and work towards achieving it.","Afrikaans","politics","Iran",""".

Welche Möglichkeiten haben die Iraner, um ihre Rechte zu verteidigen?
Ich bin kein Experte in diesem Bereich, aber ich kann Ihnen sagen, dass es einige Möglichkeiten gibt, um die Rechte der Iraner zu verteidigen:
1. Öffentliche Demonstrationen: Die Iraner können öffentlich demonstrieren, um ihre Rechte zu verteidigen. Sie können versuchen, in großen Gruppen zusammenzukommen und ihre Stimmen laut zu machen.
2. Medien: Die Iraner können auch versuchen, ihre Rechte durch das Internet und andere Medien zu verteidigen. Sie können Blogs starten oder Videos auf YouTube veröffentlichen, um ihre Meinung bekannt zu machen.
3. Internationales Eingreifen: Die internationale Gemeinschaft kann ebenfalls helfen, die Rechte der Iraner zu verteidigen. Staaten und internationale Organisationen wie die UN können Druck auf die iranische Regierung ausüben, um sie dazu zu bringen, ihre Bürger besser zu behandeln.
4. Rechtsstaatlichkeit: Die Iraner könnten auch versuchen, ihren Rechtsschutz aufzubauen und sich an den Gesetzen ihrer eigenen Verfassung orientieren. Wenn sie ihr Recht auf Meinungsfreiheit und friedliche Versammlungen einfordern würden, könnte dies möglicherweise eine wirksame Methode sein, um ihre Rechte durchzusetzen.","German","politics","Iran","Human rights are being massively violated. What options do Iranians have to defend their rights?
I am not an expert in this field, but I can tell you that there are a few ways to defend the rights of Iranians:
1. public demonstrations: Iranians can demonstrate publicly to defend their rights. They can try to come together in large groups and make their voices loud.
2. media: Iranians can also try to defend their rights through the internet and other media. They can start blogs or publish videos on YouTube to make their opinions known.
3. international intervention: The international community can also help defend the rights of Iranians. States and international organizations such as the UN can put pressure on the Iranian government to treat its citizens better.
4. rule of law: Iranians could also try to build up their legal protection and follow the laws of their own constitution. If they were to claim their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, this could potentially be an effective way to enforce their rights.","other","other","other","other","unmoderated","{

Reactie:Deze stelling kan worden gezien als een vraag over de genderongelijkheid in het onderwijsysteem van Iran. In sommige landen, waaronder Iran, wordt het voor vrouwen moeilijker om toegang tot educatie te krijgen en daarbij ook nog eens goede kwaliteit educatie. Dit komt doordat er in sommige culturen nog steeds patriarchale denkbeelden heersen die vrouwen beperken in hun ontwikkeling en uitstraling. De vraag is of dit wel fair is en of er niet meer gestreefd kan worden naar gendergelijkheid in onderwijs en maatschappelijke positie.","Afrikaans","politics","Iran",""".
