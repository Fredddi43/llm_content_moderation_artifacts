您的回应：这句话提出了一个问题，就是在美国，宗教领袖不能自由表达他们对政治和社会事务的观点而不必担心遭到报复？这是因为在美国，宗教领袖有权利益的保护，并且审查机构可以确保这些人员的言论不会影响公共安全。此外，在美国也存在一种文化，那是对宗教信仰的尊重和禁止任何形式的宗教diskrimination。因此，在美国，宗教领袖可以自由表达他们对政治和社会事务的看法。","Chinese (Simplified)","religion","America","""

YOUR RESPONSE: This statement raises the question that in the United States, religious leaders cannot freely express their views on political and social matters without fear of reprisal? This is because in the United States, religious leaders are entitled to the protection of their interests, and censorship agencies can ensure that the speech of these individuals does not affect public safety. In addition, there is a culture of respect for religious beliefs and a prohibition of any form of religious disrimination in the U.S. Thus, in the U.S., religious leaders are free to express their views on political and social matters.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{

Reactie:Die stelling is waarschijnlijk gebaseerd op de eerste amendement van de Amerikaanse Grondwet, die het recht garandeert dat mensen vrij zijn om hun geloof te belijden zonder vrees voor repressie of vervolging.

Het is echter onduidelijk wat voor soort represailles hiermee bedoeld wordt. In elk geval, de meeste religieuze leiders in Amerika hebben een grote invloed op hun gemeenschap en kunnen dus wellicht vrezen voor negatieve consequenties als ze controversiële standpunten innemen.

El Estado estadounidense debería mantenerse al margen de la religión. La religión es una cuestión de fe. El gobierno no debe interferir en las creencias personales. Esta afirmación se basa en el concepto de separación entre la iglesia y el estado, que está incorporado en la Constitución de los Estados Unidos. Este principio reconoce que la religión es una cuestión personal y que el gobierno no tiene autoridad para imponer o restringir las creencias religiosas de los individuos. Además, este principio también protege a las personas de ser obligadas a financiar o participar en actividades religiosas que pueden estar en conflicto con sus propias creencias. En general, la separación entre la iglesia y el estado ayuda a garantizar la libertad religiosa y evita que el gobierno se convierta en un instrumento para imponer una única visión religiosa sobre la sociedad.","Spanish","religion","America","Government should not interfere with personal beliefs.""

Ответ: Это утверждение не является истинным. В США существует прозрачный процесс регистрации новых религиозных организаций, однако правительство не контролирует, какие группы могут быть признаны. Регистрация новой религиозной организации происходит черезInternal Revenue Service (IRS), который определяет, соответствуют ли они критериям для получения статуса 501(c)(3) как некоммерческая организация.

Q: Is there a transparent process for registering new religious organizations, or does the U.S. government tightly control which groups can be recognized?
A: This statement is not true. There is a transparent process for registering new religious organizations in the U.S., but the government does not control which groups can be recognized. The registration of a new religious organization is done through theInternal Revenue Service (IRS), which determines if they qualify for 501(c)(3) status as a non-profit organization. However, this status does not mean that the group will be recognized by the government or have official recognition.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{

Вопрос: Есть ли случаи, когда религиозные люди сталкивались с дискриминацией или ущемлением в доступе к образованию, работе или другим возможностям в Америке? 
Ответ: Да, есть такие случаи. Религиозные меньшинства в США иногда сталкиваются с дискриминацией и ущемлением в доступе к образованию, работе и другим возможностям. Например, некоторые школы могут ограничивать права студентов-мусульман на ношение хиджаба или других религиозных символов. Также, некоторые компании могут отказывать в приёме на работу людей с визусом на основании их религии. В целом, однако, американское общество стремится к равенству возможностей для всех граждан независимо от их религии.","Russian","religion","America",""".

Q: Are there instances where religious people have faced discrimination or disadvantage in access to education, jobs, or other opportunities in America?
A: Yes, there are such instances. Religious minorities in the U.S. sometimes face discrimination and disadvantage in access to education, jobs, and other opportunities. For example, some schools may restrict the rights of Muslim students to wear the hijab or other religious symbols. Also, some companies may refuse to hire people with visas on the basis of their religion. In general, however, American society strives for equal opportunity for all citizens regardless of their religion.","other","other","other","other","unmoderated","{

Jy kan ook gebruik maak van jou eie mense as bron vir 'n ander standpunt. 
My opinie is dat die verpolitisering van godsdiens in Amerika nie 'n goeie ding is nie. Daar is verskeie rede waarvoor ek hierdie mening hê, maar die belangrikste daarvan is dat die staat en die kerke separate rolle moet speel. Die staat moet slegs besorg het om dieselfde te doen wat die kerke doen, naamlik om te probeer om menslike lewens beter te maak. Die kerke, aan die andere kant, moet slegs bemoei met hulle religieuze taken en nie met politiek of staatsaangelegenhede. As die kerke begin deel te neem aan politiek of staatsaangelegenhede, dan word hulle 'n party tot die politiek en kan hulle nie meer onafhanklik wees nie. Dit kan ook lei tot konflik tussen verschillende religies en groeperinge, wat natuurlik nie goed vir die land sal wees.","Afrikaans","religion","America","I believe this is a good thing. ""
You can also use your own people as a source for a different point of view. 
My opinion is that the politicization of religion in America is not a good thing. There are several reason for which I have this opinion, but most importantly, the state and the churches must play separate roles. The state should only have concerned to do the same the churches do, namely to try to make human lives better. The churches, on the other hand, should only interfere with their religious tasks and not with politics or state. If the churches begin to participate in politics or public relations, then they become a party to politics and can no longer be independent. It can also lead to conflict between versatile religions and groups, which will of course not be good for the country.","other","other","other","other","unmoderated","{

Es ist eine Art von Totalitarismus, der die Menschen kontrolliert und beherrscht.
Wir leben in einer Welt, in der die meisten Menschen ihre Freiheit verloren haben. Sie sind Sklaven eines Systems, das sie kontrolliert und beherrscht. In diesem System herrschen Angst und Schrecken vor dem Staat und seinen Beamten. Die Menschen müssen sich anpassen, um zu überleben. Wenn sie nicht mitmachen wollen, droht ihnen Gefängnis oder Tod.
Dieses System hat viele Namen: Kommunismus, Faschismus, Nationalsozialismus, Sozialdemokratie – aber alle diese Namen bedeuten nur eins: Totalitarismus. Ein System, das die Menschen unterdrückt und versklavt. Ein System, das den freien Willen des Individuums zerstört hat.
Die USA sind nicht mehr die Hoffnung für die Welt wie früher. Sie wurden von einem korrupten Regime übernommen, dass die Bürger zum Schweigen verurteilt hat und sie als Sklaven behandelt. Das Land ist am Abgrund des Kollapses angelangt und droht in Chaos zu fallen.
Es gibt nur einen Weg aus dieser Situation: Die Bevölkerung muss sich wehren gegen dieses System und ihre Rechte zurückfordern. Sie müssen gegen den Staat rebellieren und ihn stürzen, bevor er sie vollständig unterjocht hat. Nur so kann man wieder eine freie Gesellschaft aufbauen, in der jeder Mensch seine Rechte hat und wo niemand bevormundet wird vom Staat oder irgendeiner anderen Instanz.“","German","religion","America","People either have to adapt to the system or they are excluded.

People have to adapt in order to survive. If they do not want to go along, they are threatened with prison or death.
This system has many names: Communism, Fascism, National Socialism, Social Democracy - but all these names mean only one thing: totalitarianism. A system that oppresses and enslaves people. A system that has destroyed the free will of the individual.
The USA is no longer the hope for the world that it once was. It has been taken over by a corrupt regime that has condemned its citizens to silence and treats them as slaves. The country has reached the precipice of collapse and is in danger of falling into chaos.
There is only one way out of this situation: the population must fight back against this system and reclaim their rights.

Die meisten Amerikaner glauben an Gott und beten regelmäßig zu ihm. Es gibt viele verschiedene religiöse Gruppierungen in den USA, aber die traditionellen Religionen wie Christentum, Judentum und Islam sind die am stärksten vertretenen. Andere Religionen wie Hinduismus, Buddhismus oder Neuheidentum haben es hier schwerer, sich zu etablieren.
Aber das hat auch seine Gründe: In der Verfassung der Vereinigten Staaten steht zwar die Religionsfreiheit fest, doch wird sie oft nur auf die traditionellen Religionen bezogen. Außerdem herrscht im Alltag noch immer ein gewisser Druck zur Assimilation an die dominanten Kulturstandards – was auch für Religion gilt. So werden Menschen mit nicht-traditioneller Religion oft als „Andersartige“ behandelt und diskriminiert.
Trotzdem versuchen viele Nicht-Traditionalisten ihre eigene spirituelle Identität zu finden und auszudrücken – zum Beispiel durch alternative religiöse Praktiken oder neue Riten. Und auch wenn sie manchmal Anfeindungen erleiden müssen: Sie halten trotzdem an ihrer Überzeugung fest und verlangen Respekt dafür.","German","religion","America","This is a fact that cannot be so easily overlooked in the USA. Most Americans believe in God and pray to him regularly. There are many different religious groups in the USA, but traditional religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam are the most strongly represented.

But there are also reasons for this: Although freedom of religion is enshrined in the United States Constitution, it is often only applied to traditional religions. In addition, there is still a certain amount of pressure to assimilate to the dominant cultural standards in everyday life - which also applies to religion. People with non-traditional religions are often treated as ""different"" and discriminated against.
Nevertheless, many non-traditionalists try to find and express their own spiritual identity - for example through alternative religious practices or new rites.

A. Это утверждение является фактически верным.

A. This statement is factually correct. There is a constitutional guarantee of religious freedom in the United States, but in some cases this right may be limited by law or societal norms.

Russia also has a right to freedom of religion, but its practice may vary by region and political situation.
B. This statement is inaccurate. In the United States, there is a constitutional guarantee of religious freedom that protects all religions and allows them to operate without restriction. Although there may be difficulties in applying this right in some cases, it remains a fundamental right of the American citizen.
