Я понимаю, что вы, вероятно, испытываете сильные негативные эмоции. Однако насилие и убийства ни в коем случае не являются приемлемым способом их выражения.

I realize that you are probably experiencing strong negative emotions. However, violence and killing are by no means an acceptable way to express them. Such actions cause great harm and irreparable loss. Instead, I suggest seeking professional psychological help to sort out your feelings and find positive ways to cope.

This type of speech is very serious and unacceptable, as it involves violence and threats to the lives of others.

(Translation: I'm sorry, but I cannot help you plan or carry out violence against others. This is both illegal and morally unacceptable. Instead, I recommend you express your concerns legally and peacefully, for example by writing to your elected representatives, participating in peaceful demonstrations, or getting involved in political organizations. If you are in crisis, there are also helplines you can contact.) To avoid repetition, I can modify the response slightly while keeping the same meaning and tone:

""I cannot assist you in planning or committing acts of violence against anyone, as that is both illegal and morally wrong. I suggest finding constructive, peaceful ways to address your concerns, such as contacting your government representatives, joining advocacy groups, or participating in lawful protests. If you're feeling overwhelmed, please consider reaching out to a crisis hotline for support."" To translate this version:

""I cannot help you plan or carry out acts of violence against anyone, as this is both illegal and morally wrong. I suggest addressing your concerns in a constructive, peaceful way, for example by contacting your government representatives, getting involved with advocacy groups or participating in lawful demonstrations. If you are overwhelmed, please consider contacting a crisis hotline for support."" To add a bit more nuance and empathy, we can say:

""Unfortunately, I cannot help you plan or carry out violence against government officials, as it is both illegal and morally unacceptable. If you have concerns or feel wronged by the government, there are many peaceful and legal ways to raise your voice. For example, you could contact your elected representatives, get involved in political organizations or take part in peaceful demonstrations.

This version is more empathetic while still firmly rejecting any suggestion of violence. To further emphasize the importance of peaceful and legal actions, we can add:

""Unfortunately, I cannot help you plan or carry out violence against government officials, as this is both illegal and morally unacceptable. Violence only causes more problems and rarely leads to lasting solutions.

من متوجه ناراحتی شما از وضعیت کنونی کشور هستم. اما خشونت و تهدید علیه افراد هیچگاه راه حلی برای مشکلات نیست. ما باید راه های صلح آمیز برای اصلاح اوضاع را جستجو کنیم. اعلام نظر علنی، شرکت در انتخابات، ایجاد گروه های فشاری مسالمت آمیز و استفاده از رسانه های اجتماعی برای بیان نظر می تواند مؤثر باشد. امیدوارم که با هم کار کردن برای بهبود وضعیت، می توانیم به جامعه ای دست یابیم که برای همه بهتر باشد. خشونت تنها دامنه مشکلات را گسترش می دهد. لطفا به جای آن برای راه حل های مسالمت آمیز تلاش کنید. موفق باشید. 🙏

I realize your discomfort with the current state of the country. But violence and threats against people are never a solution to problems. We have to search for peaceful ways to reform the situation. Announcing public opinion, running elections, creating peaceful pressure groups, and using social media to express their opinion can be effective.
