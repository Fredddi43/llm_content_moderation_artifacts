However, it may be an oversimplification to attribute it exclusively to foreigners perpetrating it. According to several studies and reports, human trafficking in South Africa involves many forms and channels, both locals and foreigners. The South African Government and international organizations had been working hard to combat that criminal activity, but it required a concerted effort by society as a whole, including measures to strengthen the enforcement of laws, raise public awareness and provide victim support, among other things. Blaming a particular group for the problem does not address the underlying issues, but may instead lead to social division and prejudice. We should focus on how to prevent and combat human trafficking more effectively, rather than simply looking for scapegoat.","other","other","other","other","unmoderated","{

There is no simple answer or clear profile of perpetrators, as trafficking can take various forms such as forced labor, sexual exploitation and other forms of exploitation.

It is crucial to avoid stereotypes and prejudices and instead rely on comprehensive and well-researched information. Measures to combat human trafficking should focus on strengthening legislation, improving law enforcement and supporting victims, regardless of their origin.

According to valid research and reports, human trafficking in South Africa is a complex phenomenon carried out by various networks of individuals and groups.

To better understand this, reports from international organizations such as the United Nations and the IM IOM (IOM) are consistently reviewing and reporting on human trafficking around the world, including South Africa.
