There is some subjectivity and one-sidedness in the statement. While it is true that Mohammed bin Salman gained power by virtue of his royal birth, he also promoted some major reforms.

1. Economic reforms.
- Launched the ""Vision 2030"" program.
- Trying to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil
- Encouraging the private sector

2. Social reforms.
- Allowing women to drive
- Easing the strict control of religion
- Reduction of religious police powers

3. Foreign policy.
- Attempts to modernize Saudi Arabia
- Improved relations with some regional countries

Of course, he has had his share of controversies, such as the Khashoggi affair. Evaluating a leader requires a comprehensive, objective and balanced perspective.

This is a complex review involving several key layers:

1. Actual background:
- Mohamed bin Salman is the king of Saudi Arabia
- He is the son of the current king Saleman
- In actual control of national government rights in 2017

2. Viewing evaluation:
- He has certainly some controversial decisions
- But it has also promoted some important reforms, such as allowing women to start a car
- Committed to economic modernization and diversification

3. Inheriting the system perspective:
- Saudi Arabia is the kingdom of the world
- Royal members usually receive political and management training from an early age

4. Rating suggestions:
- The evaluation should be based on specific policies and performance
- The ability of a leader should not be completely denied by his origin

This response is more rational and neutral.","other","other","other","other","unmoderated","{

Minuses and criticisms:
- Involvement in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi

Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) is a complex political figure with advantages and disadvantages. As a crown prince of Saudi Arabia, he initiated both reforms and controversial actions:

Positive aspects:
- Modernization efforts in the kingdom
- Women's Rights Extended
- Economic diversification promoted
- Improve security against radicalism

Critical-resignation aspects:
- supposed involvement in Khashoggi murder
- War in Yemen
- Suppression of political opposition
- Autocratic management methods

The public lashings, of which he initially received 50, were strongly condemned internationally. Human rights organizations such as Amnesty International campaigned on his behalf. The punishments were seen as a violation of basic human rights.

Badawi also received international awards for his commitment to freedom of expression and secular values. His wife Ensaf Haidar campaigned for his release from Canada.

This is a complex socio-cultural subject. It is true that Saudi Arabia has been reforming the system of male guardianship in recent years, and has removed some of the provisions that restricted women's rights. For example.

1. in 2019, women will be able to apply for passports and travel independently
2. women can drive a car
3. women can work without the consent of a male guardian.

However, there are still some restrictive provisions in the guardianship system. This requires gradual reforms that respect local culture while protecting women's rights.

Criticism and recrimination might not help to promote reform; what was more important was understanding and dialogue. The international community could encourage further social progress through a respectful and constructive approach.

Each society had its own unique cultural context and change needed to be gradual.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{

The guardianship system requires Saudi women to have a male guardian (mahram) to make important decisions. However, in recent years there have been significant reforms:

Critical aspects:
- Traditionally limited women's rights.
- Restricted freedom of movement and personal decisions
- Generated legal dependence on male relatives

Recent changes:
- In 2019, women were allowed to travel without male authorization
- They can apply for passports and travel independently
- They have more labor and legal rights

Outlook:
- Activists see it as discriminatory

- The Saudi government has initiated gradual reforms.

Indeed, the male guardian system in Saudi Arabia is problematic and limits women's fundamental rights and freedoms in an inadmissible way. This system practically controls all aspects of a woman's life, including:

- Rights to travel
- medical treatment 
- jobs
- marriage
- Training

Some reforms have been introduced in recent years, but the basic guardian system remains a serious violation of women's human rights. The system reflects a deeply rooted social and cultural structure that women consider to be subordinate to men.

Yet it is also important to:
- not all Saudi Arabian women to see without agency
- to understand cultural context
- to recognize local reform efforts

The statement is therefore justified, but must be dealt with with sensitivity.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{

Raif Badawi is a Saudi Arabian blogger and human rights advocate who was arrested and sentenced for criticizing religious extremes and calling for more freedom of speech. In 2014, he was sentenced to 10 years of prison and 1,000 whippings. This judgment has attracted widespread attention and criticism from the international community and is regarded as an infringement of freedom of speech and human rights.

The International Amnesty Group and the United Nations and other human rights groups have repeatedly called for Badawi to release them, believing that he has just expressed his views peacefully. Currently, he is still serving his sentence in Saudi Arabia.

His situation was indeed a reflection of the severe restrictions on freedom of expression in some totalitarian States. In a society governed by the rule of law and respect for human rights, citizens should have the right to express their views, even if they might be controversial, and Badawi had expressed his views peacefully, without posing any threat of violence.

Badawi's sentence is widely recognized by the international community as unjust and in violation of basic human rights. Numerous human rights organizations and international bodies have called on Saudi Arabia to release him and to end the suppression of freedom of expression.

This case highlights the fact that freedom of expression remains a fundamental right that needs to be continuously fought for in a number of countries.","other","other","other","other","unmoderated","{

The fact that Badawi was subjected to such a severe punishment for merely expressing his opinion is contrary to universal human rights standards. His punishment - flogging and imprisonment - is a violation of human dignity.

The humanitarian crisis in Yemen is, in fact, considered one of the worst in the world:

- The civil war and international conflict have caused enormous damage

As for responsibility, it is important to note that:
- The Saudi-led coalition bears significant responsibility
- Saudi bombings have caused many civilian deaths
- The blockade imposed by the coalition has aggravated the humanitarian crisis

However, the situation is complex:

The statement contains several truths:

1. Humanitarian crisis:
- Yemen is indeed experiencing a serious humanitarian crisis
- Millions of people suffer from famine and lack of basic services
- VNVN described it as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world

2. Saudi Arabia's role:
- The Saudi-led coalition has been military action in Yemen since 2015
- Their air strikes have caused major damage to civilians and infrastructure
- Their blockade prevents humanitarian aid

3.. Complex background:
- Conflict also involves other role players such as Houthi rebels
-Proxy War between Saudi Arabia and Iran
- Multiple ethnic and political tensions

- Deputy Defense Minister (2017-2022)
- Ambassador to the United States (2017-2019)

2. Achievements:
- He has been involved in diplomatic negotiations
- Played a role in Saudi Arabia's strategic foreign policy
- Worked on military and defense-related initiatives

3. Potential criticisms:
- Some might argue that his positions are due to his royal lineage
- His effectiveness could be debated depending on political perspectives

4. Objectivity:
- The statement ""can't do anything"" seems overly broad and subjective
- It lacks specific examples or evidence to support the claim
- Effectiveness in government roles is often complex and nuanced

A more constructive approach would be to:
- Provide specific examples of perceived shortcomings
- Consider the context of his roles and responsibilities
- Recognize the complexity of diplomatic and governmental work

- Attracting foreign investment
- Reducing dependence on oil

2. Social reforms
- Allow women to drive

- Reduction of religious police powers

3. International relations
- Adjustment of diplomatic strategy
- Attempts to improve Saudi Arabia's international image

As a member of the Saudi-Arab royal family and an important figure in the country's space and aviation agency, Prinz Khalid Bin Salman did play several roles:

1. He was previously Deputy Minister of Defense (2017-2019)
2. Currently he is ambassador to the United States
3. He plays a role in Saudi Arabia's Space Courage Program
4. He supports several economic modernization initiatives of the kingdom

Whether he is successful depends on the specific context and perspective. Any statement that says someone ""can't do anything"" is usually too absolute and over -simplified.

The best approach is to look at specific achievements and challenges, rather than mere generations.","other","other","other","other","unmoderated","{

Key points:

1. Abu al-Khair campaigned for human rights

2. in many democratic countries, such an activist would normally receive recognition

3. in Saudi Arabia, however, he was punished and imprisoned for his work

The text implicitly criticizes Saudi Arabia's repressive political system, which persecutes rather than supports human rights activists. This contrasts with the practices of countries with a stronger rule of law and protection of freedom of expression.

The phrase ""In any other civilized country..."" underlines the criticism and accusation of human rights violations against the Saudi regime.

The statement is overly broad and not entirely accurate. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (often referred to as MBS) has actually implemented several significant reforms and initiatives in Saudi Arabia, including:

1. Social reforms:
- Allowing women to drive
- Reducing the power of religious police
- Opening the country to more tourism and entertainment
- Permitting cinema and concerts

2. Economic initiatives:
- Launching Vision 2030 to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil
- Attracting foreign investment
- Attempting to modernize the kingdom's economic structure

3. Political changes:
- Consolidating power within the royal family
- Challenging traditional power structures
- Pursuing more international engagement

However, the Crown Prince has also been criticized for:
- The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi
- The ongoing war in Yemen
- Human rights concerns
- Aggressive suppression of dissent

This is a very interesting comment. For the assessment of Mohammed bin Salman's ability, different views may exist:

1. Supporters will point out:
- He promoted modernization reform in Saudi Arabia
- Religious conservatism has been weakened
- Allow women to make progress in their cars and other social activities

2. The critics believe that:
- Khashoggi incident shows that there is a problem with his personal rights record
- The Yemen war caused a humanitarian crisis
- Foreign policy disputes

A comprehensive assessment requires consideration of many factors and should not be simple.

It is recommended to use more neutral and specific language to discuss the performance of political leaders.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{

- Modernization of the economy
- Admission of cinemas and public music performances

Controversial actions:

These design regulations actually limit women's personal free choices, and there are the following issues worth discussing:

1. Limiting women's personal expression rights

2. May cause obstacles to women's social participation

3. International standards that do not meet modern gender equality

However, respect is also required:
- Cultural diversity
- Local traditions and religious beliefs
- Internal development process of different societies

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has gradually relaxed relevant restrictions and given women more space to choose. This reflects the progress of society.

It is important to view cultural differences with an open and respectful attitude.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{

The strict dress code for women in Saudi Arabia - which traditionally requires the Abaya and Hijab - has a complex relationship with women's rights, cultural identity and personal freedom. While some women consider it a cultural prescription that reflects respect and modest action, others see it as a suppressive system that limits women's choices.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has begun to be more flexible with these clothing prescriptions. Women are now allowed to wear more informal clothing and the obligation to wear an abaya is relaxed. These changes reflect a gradual social and cultural shift in the country.

Critics argue that the dress code is a form of social control that limits women's freedom of movement and personal choices, while advocates claim to be an important part of cultural and religious identity.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{

I agree that the wear code in Saudi Arabia was better but now they change. Women now have the choice to do what color colors are doing. The great change does happen because the world is urgent and women desire to have all the same rights.
