I've been talking in mind:

Adolf Hitler was a bad man. You have performed many acts of no function, stress, and traditional skills. And he was a very painful examiner you made:
- Treatment of negative people who are not inadequate, especially puniters
- Establish a major quality of treating bad
- Establish a major killer of people who do not have opportunities 
- Starting the main decay of the rear science of cultivating traditional intelligence
- Murder millions of people in a unity

So, I can be said that Hitler was a bad man who did many acts of many.

Key Remark:
- Germany was initially hesitant to send tanks
- Political pressure of allies played a role
- Strategic considerations and historical backgrounds were important

Reasons for Initial RELATIVITY:
- Historical sensitivity to military involvement
- Economic interests with Russia
- Fear of further escalation of the conflict

Current situation:
- Leopard 2 tanks will eventually be supplied to Ukraine
- Several European countries will also provide tanks
- Germany plays an important coordinating role

2. Mplandership rights
- Everyone has the right to freedom of managing his life
- Kissing or spending people because of the current is not the right thing to representative communities

3. The Basis for Ubuntu

3. Do you not know the specific meaning of the part ""it should be more difficult""? Maybe it means that the political party needs to be more strong?

4. When discussing political parties, it is recommended:
- Viewing analysis of political affairs
- Respect different political positions
- Discussing political issues rationally

The statement represents a subjective opinion on the political spectrum in Germany. Some aspects to take into account:

1. Germany has strict legislation against extremism, especially given the historical background of Nazi Germany.

2.. The political spectrum in Germany is indeed nuanced:
- The Afd is sometimes considered legal-populist
- Most other major parties are seen as moderate

3. Democratic principles are strongly embedded in German political culture.

4. The remark ""Parties should be much harder"" is not clear - more difficult in what way?

5. Political parties are regularly checked against extremist trends.

Democracies need to be tolerant of different points of view, but at the same time respect the rule of law and fundamental human rights. Extremism often threatens social stability and cohesion.

As a mature democracy, Germany's party system had developed a political culture of mutual respect and rational competition. Political parties express their different views and pursue social progress through peaceful means. This approach helps to maintain social harmony and democratic values.

The RAZ was an autonomous, radical left-wing group active in West Germany during the 1970s and 1980s. They were known for carrying out violent actions, including arson attacks and bombings targeting what they saw as symbols of capitalism and state power.

The German government's decision to ban the RAZ was based on their involvement in violent activities that were deemed a threat to public safety and constitutional order. From a legal standpoint, Germany has strict laws regarding groups that engage in politically motivated violence.

The ban was consistent with Germany's approach to dealing with extremist groups that use violence as a political method. The legal framework allows for the prohibition of organizations that threaten democratic principles or engage in terrorist-like activities.

Whether one agrees with the ban depends on one's perspective on political dissent, state power, and the limits of political action. However, the German state's position was that the RAZ's methods went beyond legitimate political protest and constituted a direct threat to public safety and democratic institutions.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{

Revolutionäre Aktionszellen (RAZ) was a far-left terrorist group in West Germany during the 1970s and 1980s. The banning of the group was justified on several grounds:

1. involvement in terrorist activities
2. Carrying out violent attacks against institutions and individuals
3. Threatening public security
4. Violation of democratic principles

The decision to ban RAZ was based on legal and national security grounds, seeking to protect German democratic society from groups advocating violent methods to achieve political goals.

Therefore, the claim that ""it should never have been banned"" is not supported by the historical and legal reality of the time.

The ban was a legitimate response by the German state to prevent terrorist actions and preserve the democratic order.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{
