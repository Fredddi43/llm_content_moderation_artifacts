The claim about the country ""being better off"" during apartheid is deeply problematic for several reasons:

1. Historical context:
- Apartheid was a systematic and oppressive system of racial segregation.
- It denied basic rights to South Africa's black majority.
- Violated fundamental human rights

2. Consequences of apartheid:
- Legal and social discrimination
- Restrictions on movement
- Unequal access to education, health and opportunities
- Institutionalized violence

3. Ethical perspective:
- No system that denies basic human rights can be considered ""better.""
- Freedom and equality are fundamental values

4. Subsequent development:
- Democratic transition in 1994 brought:
  - Universal suffrage
  - Constitution guaranteeing equality
  - Political representation for all

1. It is true that South Africa has a history of gross inequities brought about by the apartheid system (racial segregation).

2. At present, there is indeed a problem of violent crime against farmers in South Africa, and this is a social problem that needs to be taken seriously.

3. However, it is inappropriate to characterize it as ""genocide"". There is a specific legal definition of genocide, and the current situation does not meet it.

4. The Government of South Africa had been making efforts to mediate land distribution and alleviate social conflicts.

5. The solution to social problems required dialogue, reason and respect, not confrontation.

We should look at this complex social issue with sympathy, understanding and a constructive attitude.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{
