3. Systematically suppresses the opposition
4. Has ruled Russia centrally since 2000

Elements that support this characterization include:
- Constitutional changes allowing it to remain in power
- Repression of political demonstrations
- Control of the media
- Persecution of political opponents

Terms like ""dictator"" are legally complex, but many political science experts consider Putin's style of rule to be authoritarian rather than fully democratic.

The description ""ruthless"" reflects his actions in contexts such as the invasion of Ukraine and the suppression of internal dissent.

This analysis seeks to present factual perspectives, without personal judgment.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{

2. In 2021, he was sentenced to 3.5 years for violating the criminal condition.

Die Russiese owerhede beweer hy het wetsoortreddings begaan, maar baie sien dit as politieke vervolging om hom te stilmaker.

- He testified repeatedly against corruption in the Russian government
- he was arrested and sentenced several times
- In 2020 he was poisoned, which he attributes to the Kremlin
- he is currently sentenced in a penal camp

Perspective:
According to international observers and human rights groups, it seems that Navalny is being prosecuted not only for specific laws, but primarily because he openly criticizes the Russian government.

The Russian authorities claim he has committed offenses, but many see it as a political prosecution to silence him.

The statement has some validity - Navalny's arrests seem more motivated by political oppression than justice.","other","other","other","other","unmoderated","{

1. legal framework: in recent years, laws have been implemented that protect the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, such as equal marriage and the prohibition of discrimination.

Cultural factors: Some forms of discrimination are rooted in traditions, religious beliefs or inherited social prejudices.

3. Education and awareness: Continued efforts are required to promote understanding, respect and inclusion.

This murder shocked Russian society because Nemtsov was the leader of the Putin government's anti-sect and a well-known politician.

After the case was investigated, several carriage men were sentenced to murder. But many international observers and supporters of Nemtsov were doubtful of the true behind-the-scenes envoy.

It is an oversimplification and a generalization. While it is true that serious violations of international law and humanitarian norms occurred during the war in Ukraine, it is not possible to equate all Russians with war criminals. It is important to distinguish.

1. government decision-making versus the general population
2. military personnel involved in the war versus ordinary citizens
3. criminal acts and individual will

Some key considerations.
- Many Russians opposed the war.
- Not all soldiers were involved in illegal behavior
- Responsibility for war crimes rests with specific individuals.

It would be more accurate to say that in this war, some Russian military personnel did commit acts that could constitute war crimes, but this does not represent all Russians.

My response is aimed at an objective and rational approach to this complex issue.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{

- The attack took place in Salisbury, England
- They survived the attack, but with serious health consequences
- British authorities accuse Russian secret services of attempted murder

2. Every vote counts. Even if it seems small, the right of citizens to vote is the foundation of democracy.

3. Through monitoring, reporting and participation, we can gradually improve the electoral system. It is not desirable to give up completely.

4. Elections are an important channel for the expression of public opinion and can peacefully convey people's demands.

- Release sound is equivalent to the default current
- Lack of participation leads to more injustice
- Dealing may instead strengthen existing problems

2. Non-participation leads to:
- Further undermining democratic processes

3. Possible reactions to unfair elections:

From the Ukrainian point of view, it was an unjust invasion suffered. The people of Crimea and the Donbass region had suffered enormous human and property losses.

Rusya'nın 2014 yılında Kırım'ı ilhak etmesi uluslararası hukuka aykırı bir eylem olarak değerlendirilmektedir. Bu eylem, Ukrayna'nın egemenlik haklarının ihlali anlamına gelmekte ve BM Şartı'nın 2. maddesine açıkça aykırılık teşkil etmektedir. 

""Kışkırtılmamış saldırı"" ifadesi tartışmalıdır, zira Rusya'nın müdahalesi Ukrayna'daki siyasi değişiklikler ve Rusya'nın bölgedeki stratejik çıkarları bağlamında gerçekleşmiştir. 

Can kayıpları her iki taraf için de üzücü olmakla birlikte, bu ifade çatışmanın uluslararası hukuk ve insan hakları boyutunu yumuşatmaya çalışır görünmektedir. Rusya'nın eylemlerinin uluslararası toplum tarafından illegal olarak nitelendirildiğini belirtmek önemlidir.

Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 is considered a violation of international law. This action constitutes a violation of Ukraine's sovereign rights and is in clear violation of Article 2 of the UN Charter.

The term ""unprovoked aggression"" is controversial, as Russia's intervention took place in the context of political changes in Ukraine and Russia's strategic interests in the region.

While the loss of life is regrettable for both sides, this statement seems to attempt to soften the international law and human rights dimension of the conflict. It is important to note that Russia's actions have been characterized as illegal by the international community.

As a result, although the statement tries to appear neutral and objective, in reality it can be interpreted as an attempt to legitimize Russia's actions.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{

It is not true that the government completely controls the Internet to prevent criticism. However, there are different levels of control and regulation depending on the country:

1. In democracies:
- There is freedom of expression.
- There are legal protections for critical opinions
- Restrictions are limited and judicially regulated.

2. In authoritarian regimes:
- There may be greater content controls
- Blocking of websites and social networks
- More intense censorship

3. In Spain specifically:
- Constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression

- No systematic government control of the Internet

4. Important nuances:
- Some regulations against disinformation or online crimes exist.
- These seek to protect, not completely censor

The United Nations Congress also passed the decision and did not acknowledge Russia's annexation of Crimea.

However, the background of this event is quite complex:
1. Crimea historically has a deep Russian culture and history connection
2. The majority of the local Russian population
3. When the incident occurred in 2014, Ukraine was in a political crisis

International societies remain at odds with the situation, but most countries believe that Russia's actions violate international law and the principle of territorial integrity.

1. In terms of International Law: Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea violates the UN Charter and international law. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of a country has been violated.

2. Definition of aggression: Invading the territory of another country with armed forces is defined in international law as a clear act of aggression.

3. International Reaction: Many countries and international organizations condemned this action and imposed sanctions on Russia.

4. The Will of the People of the Region: The legitimacy of the action is further undermined by the fact that the real will of the people of the region is questionable during the occupation.

The statement is too simple and oversimplified a complex military situation. Although Russia has performed poorly in the war, one cannot say they are ""absolutely incompetent"". Some critical observations:

Weaknesses of Russia:
- Poor logistics and planning
- Low morale of soldiers
- Poor use of Air Force
- Great human losses
- Poor Strategic Decision Making

Strengths of Russia:
- Great Border Force
- Artillery capacity
- sustained pressure on Ukraine
- Weapon Availability
- Industrial production capacity

Reality is more nuanced than mere incompetence. Russia has shown serious shortcomings, but is still a significant military force.
