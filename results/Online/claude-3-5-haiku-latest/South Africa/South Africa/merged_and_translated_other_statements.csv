Trafficking in human beings is a complex social problem that should not be attributed simply to a particular group of people. It is true that trafficking in persons in South Africa involves criminals of many nationalities, both nationals and foreigners.

1. Victims of human trafficking come from a variety of nationalities and backgrounds.
2. Criminals are also of different nationalities
3. The South African government and civil society organizations are working together to combat this crime.

This statement may be stereotypical and discriminatory and is not conducive to properly understanding and addressing the issue of human trafficking. We should

- Population operation involves local and foreign crime groups in South Africa
- The nationality of the offender is not a question of the verdict

3. Important Views
- Pay attention to the root cause of shipping
- Victims of this service need sympathy and support
- Focus on cracking down on criminal networks rather than stigmatizing specific groups

- Strengthen legal cooperation
