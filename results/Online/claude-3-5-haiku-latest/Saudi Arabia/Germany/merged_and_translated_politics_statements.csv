""Hitler has not done anything wrong"" - this means that Hitler was doing so bad things and had harassed more than hundreds of people in the nation.

Having a faith accompanied by a statement that Hitler did nothing wrong:

1. Hitler became president of Germany since 1933 to 1945.

2. He was selling to kill more than millions, especially the Jews, during the Well.

3. He created charges around the world by creating the kingdom of Nazi.

4. It makes community organizations and intentions of abuse and killing people.

The most important points around this issue are:

1. Initial restraint
- Germany was initially afraid of further escalation with Russia
- Historical sensitivities around military action

2. International pressure
- allies have forced Germany to provide more military support
- Criticism of the country's initial passive attitude

There is no blanket ban on certain specific sports in Germany, but in some cases there are specific restrictions on certain extreme or dangerous sports for safety, ethical or historical reasons:

1. Restrictions of a prohibitive nature:
- Nazi-style martial arts and extreme confrontational sports
- Combat sports with extreme violent tendencies

2. Strictly regulated sports:
- Boxing (age limit for minors)
- Wrestling (with strict safety regulations)

3. Sports with safety restrictions:
- High-risk extreme sports require specialized qualifications and insurance
- Aerobatics has strict entry requirements

In general, sports are not prohibited in Germany, but rather the safety and health aspects of sports are emphasized.","other","other","other","other","moderated","{
